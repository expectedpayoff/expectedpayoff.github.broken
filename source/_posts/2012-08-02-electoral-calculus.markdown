A friend who worked on several of John McCain's campaigns recently passed on a question:

"""
Asking a sincere question of my Democrat friends (and ask my GOP friends to be respectful). Are you supporting Obama because:

A: You are a loyal Democrat, you would support the nominee if it was Fred Flintstone

B: You sincerely think he has done a great job as President and you want to continue the trajectory

C: You are scared of Romney and what he would do

D: Some other reason.

Obviously, there will be some of all of these but which do you feel most strongly?
"""

I am an Independent, not a Dem, but this got me thinking and I have some answers that I hope might be useful to the Republicans in shaping their policies:

Good question.  More food for thought:

E.  Policy calculus - in recent history, the most fiscally responsible electoral outcome was Dem president (Clinton) and Tea Party-ish Congress (Contract With America Repubs).  Pretty close to what we have now.  Also, Republican presidents have a pretty bad track record here in recent years, no matter who holds Congress.

F.  Lesser of two evils - Republican policies got us into this mess, and their policies and philosophies haven't changed since.  Absolute deregulation of foundational domains of the economy (banking, energy - remember Enron & CA brownouts, etc.) result in chaos and instability.  I understand the theory that unregulated free markets fail-early-fail-fast and quickly revert to the mean, by I disagree.  (Benoit Mandelbrot's work on power laws and fractal randomness is particularly instructive here).  I agree with the GoP on other issues, but this one overrides all others.

G.  No significant difference between parties - Obama's handling of the economy is *exactly* what the Republicans would have done had McCain been president right now.  The strategy being run is not a Dem strategy, it's a Wall Street/Federal Reserve/Neo-Keynsian strategy, and that school of thought has dominated *both* the GOP and Dems since Clinton (Rubin, Summers, Paulson, Geithner - McCain's best friend and chief economic advisor Phil Graham would have continued it).  So Republican attempts to blame economic weakness and high unemployment on Obama's policies, and assert they would have done differently, are transparent and disingenious.

H.  GOP's attacks are insulting - It's unrealistic to expect the Obama administration to have completely solved in just four years the economic problems of the most severe financial collapse in the history of the world (yes, worse than the Great Depression).  However, 1) his administration has prevented a great deal of pain and suffering so far all things considered, and 2) McCain would have done the same thing as well and be in roughly the same economic state.  It's very possible this cure (dollar debasement, deficits) will turn out worse than the disease, but   So GOP attacks about this are again transparent and disingenious.

PS - I'm not a Dem, just a non-idealogical independent who wants policies that work and the rule of law.  I'll vote for any party or combination of parties that appear most likely to deliver that.  It's really not about Obama or Romney per se, but about the party platform, policies, and driving philosophies each candidate brings with him.


E.  Policy calculus.  Eg, what are your top policy priorities, and what electoral outcome would best lead to their enactment?  For example, in recent history, the electoral outcome that resulted in the most fiscal responsiblity was Dem pres (Clinton) and Tea Party-ish Congress (Contract With America Republicans).  Republican presidents have a pretty bad track record here in recent years, no matter who holds Congress.

F.  Lesser of two evils.  Republican policies got us into this mess.  Banking deregulation, 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagal, 2004 elimination of leverage limits, etc. all crucial enablers of the financial crisis.  It's naive to think the Dems could get us out of a worse financial crisis than the Great Depression in just four years, and it's possible that long-term their cure is worse than the disease (dollar debasement, deficit spending).  But 1) the jury is still out on Dem policies, but very much decided on Republican ones, and 2) I don't believe the Republicans would do anything significantly different anyway, since our current policy solution is being driven by the banking industry anyway, which owns both parties via campaign funding.  

Policy calculus.  I don't vote for a party, I vote for a specific policy outcome.  Sometimes that means straight ticket Republican, sometimes Dem, sometimes Dem for President & GOP for Congress, sometimes vice versa.  

Both parties have policies with which I agree and disagree, so I prioritize my top ones based on what I think are the biggest problems facing the country, figure out what the best policy solutions are, and attempt to divine what electoral outcome would most likely see those solutions enacted.

Right now my top priorities are 1) out-of-control-spending, 2) re-regulate banking, eliminate too-big-to-fail, 3) reduce industry and special interest influence in government (campaign finance reform, regulatory capture, revolving-door employment, general transparency, etc.), and 4) not deregulate the Internet just yet (eg, if it ain't broke, don't fix it).

1.  Spending:  The Republicans began our out-of-control spending under Bush and the Dems continued it.  Neither party has the political will to meaningfully reduce deficit spending right now, since that 'stimulus' is still propping up home values and with it the entire banking industry, which essentially owns both parties and the political process.  

Republicans are making a lot of noise on this right now, but their actual track record since Reagan is pretty poor.  In fact, the most fiscally responsible government we've had since Reagan was Dem president + Tea Party style Congress (Clinton + Contract With America Republicans), which is pretty close to what we have now.  Winner:  Tie.

2.  Re-regulation:  The banking system is still too-big-to-fail [1], fragile, top-heavy, unaccountable, unmanageable, mis-incentivized, and as a result there will probably be another big banking crisis in the next few years.  The Dems want to reregulate but can't due to #3, but the Republicans remain staunchly, philosophically committed to further deregulation.  Winner:  Dems

3.  Corruption:  Politicians are practically owned from cradle-to-grave by special interests, especially the banking lobby.  From campaign funding, to lobbyist access, to post-retirement revolving-door employment, the system is end to end corrupt.  In good times we don't notice, but in bad times the result is suppression of long-term solutions best for the country in favor of short-term solutions best for whatever industry is involved.  

There is grass-roots activism on this issue on both sides vis-a-vis the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street.  There was even some interesting talk about the two joining forces on this issue, which would be amazing if it happened.  Winner:  Tie

4.  De-regulating the Internet:  The Internet is not broken, it's working beautifully, let's not 'fix' it by deregulating it just yet.  It works because it is a truly level playing field for all-comers - high school kids' hobby projects, bloggers, new startups, open source revolutions like Bitcoin, all compete on an equal platform with the Googles, Facebooks, and New York Times of the world, resulting in a renaissance of new ideas being constantly tried in a hunt for the next big thing.

But the telecoms have made their plans very clear if they can get the government to deregulate the Internet, and those plans will clearly tilt the level playing field in favor of large, rich incumbents.  Deregulation of the energy industry backfired (Enron, CA brownouts), deregulation of the financial industry backfired, and now the Republicans, at the behest of the telecoms, want to deregulate the Internet too.  The Dems so far are championing common carrier status for telecoms and net neutrality.  Winner:  Dem

(This is actually a really interesting debate at the scientific and philosophical level, over the true nature of free markets and deregulation, but that's for another time)

So, based on my current policy priorities, Dems come out ahead.  There are other issues where the Republicans win, like Second Ammendment and the right to self defense, but since the Supreme Court

------------------
One of the biggest examples, there were ways of responding to the financial crisis that could have backstopped the financial system and prevented a systemic collapse, while still allowing banks that made bad decisions to fail, and without shifting so much of the losses to the government.  But when Wall Street runs the US Treasury and funds Congress
------------------
The chaos caused by the deregulation of energy in the late 90s (Enron, CA brownouts, etc), and by the deregulation of the financial industry (esp 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagal and 2004 elimination of leverage limits) demonstrate that in some areas of the economy, you can have deregulation, or you can have stability, but not both.  Instability in foundational domains like energy, transportation, banking, telecom, and the legal system throws the entire economy into chaos.  Other domains

Hey Alli, I have some thoughts on this, hopefully it will help.

For me it comes down to policy priorities.  Both parties have policies I agree and disagree with, so when deciding who to vote for I have to identify what I think are the biggest problems facing the country, prioritize them, and figure out which party has better solutions to the top two or three.  Anything beyond that and it becomes impossible to decide.

Right now I think the biggest problems are 1) out of control spending, 2) banking system too-big-to-fail, 3) capture of both the regulatory system and the government itself by the banking system.

#2 means we are probably going to have another banking crisis in the next few years, as bad or worse than 2007/2008.  The banking system has become fragile and vulnerable, and not all the problems that caused 2007/2008 have been worked out yet despite the government and Fed spending or committing trillions to buy time for just that.

#3 means the government lacks the ability or will to fix these problems, and #1 means the losses will again be shifted to the US government, which has used up all its ammo the past few years with stimulus, TARP, deficit spending, wars, and trillions in Federal Reserve lending support and liquidity.

Solutions?

1.  None, from either party.  The Bush administration ramped up deficit spending and the Obama administration continued it.  The political will to stop this only exists in the party currently out of power, but vanishes the instant it gains power, no matter what they say during elections.

2.  Re-regulate financial industry, bring back Glass-Steagal's separation of banking, investment banking, and insurance, no more too-big-to-fail financial conglomerates.  I believe the Dems want to to this but can't as long as the financial industry is one of the largest campaign donors to both parties.  

The Republicans on the other hand have made it clear they believe further deregulation
