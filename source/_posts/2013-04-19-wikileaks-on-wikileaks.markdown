An enlightening demonstration of the motivations behind Wikileaks, from the transcript 
of a secret meeting in 2011 between Julian Assange and Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO).

*So, on the one hand we have live dynamic services and organizations... well there's 
three things. Live dynamic services. Organizations that run those services, so that you 
are referring to a hierarchy. You are referring to a system of control. An organization, 
a government, that represents an organized evolving group. And on the other hand you have 
artefacts. You have human intellectual artefacts that have the ability to be completely 
independent from any system of human control. They are out there in the Platonic realm 
somehow. And shouldn't in fact be referred to by an organization. They should be referred 
to in a way that is intrinsic to the intellectual content, that arises out of the 
intellectual content! I think that is an inevitable and very important way forward, and 
where this... where I saw that this was a problem was dealing with a man by the name of 
Nahdmi Auchi. A few years ago was listed by one of the big business magazines in the UK 
as the fifth richest man in the UK. In 1980 left Iraq. He'd grown rich under Saddam 
Hussein's oil industry. And is alleged by the Italian press to be involved in a load of 
arms trading there, he has over two hundred companies run out of his Luxembourg holding 
unit. And several that we discovered in Panama. He had infiltrated the British Labour 
political establishment to the degree that the 20th business birthday in London he was 
given a painting signed by 146 members Commons including Tony Blair. He's the same guy 
who was the principal financier of Tony Rezko. Tony Rezko was the financier and fundraiser 
of Rod Blagoyevich, from Chicago. Convicted of corruption. Tony Rezko has been convicted 
of corruption. And Barack Obama. He was the intermediary who helped Barack Obama buy one 
of his houses and then the money not directly for the house but it bouyed up Tony Rezko's 
finances came from that... [indistinct]. So during the - this is detail, but it will get 
to a point. During the 2008 presidential primaries a lot of attention was turned to Barack 
Obama by the US press, unsurprisingly. And so it started to look into his fundraisers, and 
discovered Tony Rezko, and then they just started to turn their eyes towards Nadhmi Auchi. 
Auchi then hired Carter Ruck, a rather notorious firm of London libel solicitors, whose 
founder, Carter Ruck, has been described as doing for freedom of speech what the Boston 
strangler did for door to door salesmen.*

*And he started writing letters to all of the London papers who had records of his 2003 
extradition to France and conviction for corruption in France over the Elf-Acquitaine scandal. 
Where he had been involved in taking kickbacks on selling the invaded Kuwaiti governments' oil 
refineries in order to fund their operations while Iraq had occupied it. So the Guardian pulled 
three articles from 2003. So they were five years old. They had been in the Guardian's archive 
for 5 years. Without saying anything. If you go to those URLs you will not see "removed due to 
legal threats." You will see "page not found." And one from the Telegraph. And a bunch from some 
American publications. And bloggers, and so on. Important bits of history, recent history, that 
were relevant to an ongoing presidential campaign in the United States were pulled out of the 
intellectal record. They were also pulled out of the Guardian's index of articles. So why? The 
Guardian's published in print, and you can go to the library and look up those articles. They 
are still there in the library. How would you know that they were there in the library? To look 
up, because they are not there in the Guardian's index. Not only have they ceased to exist, 
they have ceased to have ever existed. Which is the modern implementation of Orwell's dictum 
that he controls the present controls the past and he who controls the past controls the future. 
Because the past is stored physically in the present. All records of the past. This issue of 
preserving politically salient intellectual content while it is under attack is central to what 
WikiLeaks does -- because that is what we are after! We are after those bits that people are 
trying to suppress, because we suspect, usually rightly, that they're expending economic work 
on suppressing those bits because they perceive that they are going to induce some change."*
