Yesterday I watched a [Bloomberg News segment][1] on Bitcoin, which raised a 
number of questions about the cryptocurrency.  All of these have been answered
before but the journalists apparently weren't aware of that (except perhaps the host, 
Sara Eisen, who seems to have done her homework).  

Following are the answers to these questions, as well as some additional, unanswered, 
questions and issues the segment could have raised but didn't.

**Q:**  *[Bitcoin has] no power to tax*

**A:**  The implicit assumption of this statement is that currencies gain value because 
they are the exclusive means of remitting taxes to the issuing government.  If 
all citizens are required by law to pay taxes in this currency, then come tax 
time they must convert wealth from other forms into this currency to pay taxes,
creating demand for that currency.  Since tax time in most developed countries is
a ubiquitous, ongoing, daily occurence (sales tax), then there is a ubiquitous, 
ongoing, daily demand for that currency, giving it constant steady value.

However, asking that question implies a narrow view of that aspect of currencies.
While modern, government-issued, government debt-backed currencies typiclly gain 
value from their status as taxation legal tender, that is not the only way.
Anything that creates demand for a currency can give it value.  

For example, the US dollar is also the primary currency for purchasing oil in the 
world.  Any country that needs to buy oil (almost all of them), must convert either 
its own currency or other wealth into dollars to buy oil, increasing demand for the 
dollar, and hence its value.

Another way in which value is imparted to the US Dollar, it is the only currency by 
which one may purchase what has for the past half century (until the recent financial 
crisis at least) been considered the risk-free rate of return - short-term 
[US Treasury Bills][10].  

Financial instability in Europe or other parts of the world tends to result in the 
movement of wealth from investment in riskier assets to investment in US Treasuries 
for this reason, and this fallback status grants the dollar another source of demand 
and value not available to other currencies.

Another example is gold, simply because it induces a singular psychological response
in most humans: charitably - awe at its luster and beauty, uncharitably - desire, 
avarice.  In either case, gold induces demand among humans purely psychologically, 
independent of any functional use it may have, and this is the source from which its 
value as a currency is hisorically derived.

Bitcoin may not derive value from its status as exclusive medium of tax remitance, 
but that has no bearing on whether it is a currency or not.  Rather, it must meet
the three criteria for definition of a currency:

1.  A medium of exchange
2.  A unit of account
3.  A store of value

Bitcoin is certainly a medium of exchange with global scope and efficient payment and 
transfer capabilities, moreso than any traditional currency, the latter part even
moreso than the US Dollar.  Transactions are, like cash, non-reversible, requiring
buyers to truly *caveat emptor*, but transactions anywhere in the world are completed
in a matter of minutes and locked in (confirmed) in just a few hours.

Bitcoin provides units of [account][16], the smallest being the Satoshi, or 
0.00000001 BTC (eight decimal places, or in scientific notation, 1.0 x 10^-8).

Finally, is Bitcoin a store of value?  Truthfully the jury is still out on that.  Some 
pertinent questions, that the Bloomberg presenters could have been asking here:

1.  Will its price stablize?  Volatility is generally not associated with store of
value.

2.  Will it appreciate over time?  Depreciation is generally not associated with store
of value.  However, this is a test every debt-backed, inflationary currency, 
including US Federal Reserve Notes, fails, at least as measured per unit of currency.

3.  What are the long-term technical risks of relying completely on the Internet as
both system and database?  The Internet is remarkably technically resilient, and
bitcoin is designed to be so as well, but are there systemic risks that could
undermine it?  For example, wide-scale power outages due to solar storms, or
control by malicious actor of more than 50% of the computing power of the network.
What are the safeguards and redundancies against such events?

4.  What are the long-term regulatory risks?  Will governments find ways to regulate
bitcoin into uselessness to protect their monopoly on currency issuence?

These are all pertinent critques that a professional news organization like Bloomberg 
*should* be asking of Bitcoin right now.

**Q:**  *Who finances it?*

**A:**  No one.  It doesn't work like traditional banks and currencies, so stop thinking 
of it in those terms.  Bitcoin is [FOSS - Free Open Source Software][14].  It is 
created by hobbyists and concerned citizens working together over the internet, the 
same as [GNU/Linux][12], [BSD Unix][13], and scads of other highly successful open 
source software projects that run most of the Internet's infrastructure.  

"Free" has an intentional double meaning here:

1.  Free as in Liberty - you can download the software, modify it, borrow from it, 
redistribute it, whatever you want.  Bitcoin is licensed under the clear, 
simple [MIT License][4].  Free as in zero restrictions what you can do with it.

2.  free as in no monetary cost - you pay nothing to download and use it.  No 
upfront fee, no recurring subscription fees, no hidden taxes down the road, not 
even any embedded advertising.  Completely free.

Having said that, bitcoin does require an infrastructure:  the Internet, plus 
participants in the Bitcoin network who have decided to set up ["mining"][6] 
operations by which new Bitcoins are created.  

The Internet obviously was originally financed by taxpayers, and ongoing financing 
comes from the citizens and organizations who pay fees to connect and use it.

The Bitcoin Mining operations are funded mainly by the [innovators and early 
adopters][5] who saw value in Bitcoin early, and purchased the computer hardware
necessary for [calculating the hash algorithm][8] that creates bitcoins.  Their ROI
for that is a set amount of bitcoins every time their system finds an answer to 
the [hash algorithm][7] (lots of answers possible, all relatively difficult 
to find).

So, if Bitcoin is "financed" by anyone, it is the total computing effort of all 
participants mining bitcoins, from individuals to [pools][9].


**Q:**  *sounds like an ameoba*

**R:**  An amoeba?  Srsly bro?  You're on  *Bloomberg News*, not Fox News.  Lets try to
maintain a little higher standard of rigor here.

**Q:**  *Is there any fundamental justifcation for appeal of bitcoin*

**R:**  Yes, that its value is derived in such a way that it can't be compromised by a central
bank bailing out a fraudulent banking system.  The mechanism by which Bitcoin is 
created and operates is transparent, open, and F/free to the entire world, and more 
difficult for any one entity or cartel to control and manipulate for the benefit of 
some at the expense of others.

Whereas prevailing national currency regimes are run by obfuscated operations of the 
world's central banks and [their parent organization][11], all of which are privately 
owned institutions (though usually government-chartered, with the exception of the BIS) 
whose interests may conflict with those of the citizens of the countries in which 
they operate.  The recent financial crisis has highlighted this inherent conflict of 
interest, in which national currencies, national debt, and [national savings][15] are 
all being risked to "socialize private losses".

As a result, despite bitcoin's relative immaturity and current price volatility, 
some people perceive it as an option for a long term store of value relative to 
the debt-backed government currencies in which they no longer trust the issuer to
act in citizens' best interest.  Bitcoin's intrinsic math and mechanisms are set, and 
are the same now as they will be 20 years from now, making it a viable long term bet
for those who understand the algorithm, the infrastructure, and the general risks.  
These people have been early adopters, driving up demand for bitcoin, and as a result 
its value and appeal to others.


**Q:**  *I look at Bitcoin and I think to myself, [like] Farmville, this is virtual nonsense*

**R:**  I never played Farmville, so can't comment extensively on it.  But, Farmville's virtual 
currency is issued by a for-profit private company, on a for-profit social network, 
for the purpose of making those companies a profit.

Bitcoin is issued by an open, transparent network in which anyone in the world can 
freely participate in the creation of the currency (and share in the profits that go 
along with it, at least up until the last bitcoin is created at 21 million).  

And, can you even buy anything outside of Farmville with Farmville's currency?

Just because two things are "virtual" does not mean they are comparable. 

**Q:**  *"And the fear of the algorithm, think of all the problems we've seen, if you talk to any 
critics of HFT, and they talk about you don't want to be in a situation where you're
dependent on an algorithm, and we're talking about actual currency here."*

**A:**  We're dependent on algorithms all the time.  What do you think runs the entire Internet,
financial exchanges, the power grid, mobile phone systems, etc.  [HFT][18] is a special case 
of many disparate, complex, opaque, proprietary algorithms competing against each 
other, interacting in sometimes [emergent][19], unpredictable ways (Flash Crashes).  

Bitcoin is a case of a single (or few), relatively simple algorithm/s, working together 
in the same system to solve a [well-defined mathematical problem][17] that just wasn't 
solvable until the invention of the Internet, public key crytpography, and the Bittorrent 
distributed communication protocol.

Again, just because two things are "algorithms" does not mean they are comparable. 

**Q:**  *We will hear a lot more about it, but will it be in the context of things like Zynga's 
share price that reflects people's lack of confidence in "virtual" things?*

**A:**  Again, see answer above re: Farmville.
