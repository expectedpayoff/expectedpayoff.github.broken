I played soccer from when I was about 9 years old through high school, and have remained a lifelong fan, but despite that I never realized the extent and depth of tactics employed in the game, especially at the highest levels (World Cup, European and English league championships, South America).  Thanks to [Zonal Marking][1], I do now.
