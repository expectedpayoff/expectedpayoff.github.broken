How will personal computers + 3d printing revolutionize the wealth creation?  Let me count the ways:

1.  Reverse outsourcing of cheap things.  No longer will run-of-the-mill everyday cheap things be made overseas and imported.  Rather, people will make them at home and buy the raw materials (plastic powder, etc).  Things like household tools, utensils, etc. will simply be made at home from digital designs shared on the internet.

Some things simply won't be made in factories anymore - any kind of inexpensive thing that is not significantly complex.  Fine, exquisite, artisan, handmade things, like Stradivarious violins, will continue being handmade and valued as such.  

2.  Education - you thought computers alone were educational, wait till your kids get a computer with a 3d printer!

3.  The ultimate in lean manufacturing - no more guessing how much to produce to meet market demand, rather individuals will simply print either a single object or exactly the quantity they require to solve whatever problem or supply whatever they need they have at that moment.  The estimation and forecasting will shift to the production of 3D printing raw materials instead, but these can afford to be much less precise and even accurate, simply because unlike a spoon or wrench, the raw materials can be used to make anything, solve any problem, address any need, supply any demand.  Prediction will be more aggregate, less specific, making forecasting easier.

4.  Send each other gifts via email+printer rather than via UPS+Amazon.  Uh Oh...
