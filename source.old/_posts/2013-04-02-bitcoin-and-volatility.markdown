- what is bitcoin's lifetime volatility
- compare to stable currencies:  dollar's?  euro's?  yen's?  loon's?  sterling
- compare to newer and/or less stable currencies:  yuan, real, peso, 
- what was gold's historical volatility, pre-1971, post-1971? 
- does anchoring interest rate bound a currency's volatility?

The history of modern finance has been about finding ways of stabilizing currency values and exchange rates.  Low volatility is clearly a 
desirable feature of a currency.  Should low volatility be added to the cannonical defintion of currency, in addition to store of value, 
unit of account, means of transaction?

One reason debt-backed currencies are relatively stable (vs stocks, commodities, and bitcoin) is that they are pegged to an interest rate, in the case of the dollar the (at least what used to be) the risk-free rate of return. You can even think of them as derivatives of the interest rate, for a loose definition of derivative.
This bounds their volatility in a way that bitcoin can't, and makes me wonder if the lack of a similar stabilizing mechanism isn't a long-term flaw in bitcoin's design.
The only way I can see bitcoin ever reaching a similar level of stability is for its market cap to reach a level such that it stabilizes under sheer weight and momentum rather than any built-in mechanic, which could require exceeding that of all other currencies combined (making speculation and market manipulation difficult or impossible), no small feat.
